# KrCurve-Data-assimilation

The objective of this work is to infer the relative permeability curve kr(S) from measurable data such as saturation and production time series. 

The proposed methodology is to use ensemble Kalman method, which has the advantage of being non-intrusive and parallel and does not need adjoint solver. The methodology is implemented by coupling the
